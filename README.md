# tic-tac-toe-game

Tic Tac Toe is a popular two-player game that can be implemented using JavaScript. 
The game is played on a 3x3 grid, and the goal is to place three of your symbols (either "X" or "O") in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.


My code for a Tic Tac Toe game includes the following elements:

1) A game board represented as a two-dimensional array
2) Variables to keep track of the current player (X or O)
3) Event listeners to detect when a player clicks on a square on the game board
4) Functions to check for a win or a draw
5) A game loop to handle the flow of the game
